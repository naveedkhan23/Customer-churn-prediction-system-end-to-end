# End-to-End Customer Churn Prediction System
## Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge for subscription-based businesses, directly impacting revenue and long-term growths.
This project presents a production-ready, end-to-end machine learning system that predicts customer churn using structured customer data and deploys the trained model as an interactive web application.

The project demonstrates industry-standard machine learning engineering practices, including data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, explainability, and deployment.

## Problem Statement

Predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service) based on historical customer demographics, service usage, and the billing information.

### Business Objective:
Enable proactive customer retention by identifying high-risk customer early.

## Solution Approach

The system follows a complete machine learning lifecycle:
- Data ingestion and cleaning
- Feature encoding and engineering
- Model training and comparison
- Model evaluation using appropriate metrics
- Model explainability
- Deployment for real-time inference


## Dataset

- Dataset: Telco Customer Churn Dataset
- Type: Structured tabular data
- Target Variable: Churn (Yes / No)
- Challenge: Class imbalance (more non-churn than churn customers)

## Models Used

Multiple classification model were trained and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression:-	Baseline & interpretable model
- Random Forest:- Non-linear ensemble comparisons
#### Final Model Selection

Logistic Regression was selected based on:
- Highest ROC-AUC score
- Model stability

Interpretability (important for business & regulatory use)

## Model Performance
- Primary Metric: ROC-AUC
- Secondary Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

Metric	Value:
- ROC-AUC	~0.84
- Accuracy	~0.80
- Churn Recall	~0.57

These results indicate strong discriminative ability on an imbalanced dataset.

## Model Explainability

To ensure transparency and trust, model explainability was incorporated using Logistic Regression coefficients.

Key benefits:
- Identification of major churn drivers
- Business-interpretable insights
- Alignment with explainable AI practices

Top influencing features include:
- Contract type
- Customer tenure
- Monthly charges
- Payment method

## Deployment

The trained model is deployed using Streamlit, enabling real-time churn probability predictions from user inputs.

Features:
- Human-readable inputs
- Probability-based output
- Robust feature alignment
- Production-safe inference logic
